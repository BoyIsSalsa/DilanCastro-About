    <p class="description">Dilan is my grlorious king who I will always want with me, everyday and all the time, if any girl that wants him is reading this ill slide hiss @. And for adrian, a beaner boy that loves the audacity to blast a soccer ball. And Adam, big black boy, we are all trusting the bulk for him right now, he is in the state of anger because he cant control his stomach when he eats, causing him to yell. And the final Nominee, is Eli, a super white dude that we trusted the bulk and he actually delivered with pride on weighing almost 200 pounds as of right now. Now we all hope for the best because one of these is making out of here with their cock in my hand.</p>
